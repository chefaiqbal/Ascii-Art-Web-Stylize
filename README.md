# Ascii-Art-Web-Stylize
ðŸŽ¨ Ascii-Art-Web-Stylize is an exciting project that merges ASCII art generation with a user-friendly web interface. It builds upon the foundation of the original ascii-art project, elevating it with various captivating banner styles. This project harnesses a Go-based web server to craft a harmonious user experience.


## Description

Ascii-Art-Web-Stylize empowers users to effortlessly generate ASCII art banners via a web interface. It offers a selection of banner styles, including shadow, standard, and thinkertoy. Users can easily input their desired text, choose a banner style, and with a single click, create visually appealing ASCII art.

## Implementation Details
### ASCII Art Generation Algorithm

The ASCII art generation process follows these steps:

1. **Banner Format**:
   - Each character is represented by an 8-line pattern in the banner style.
   - Characters are separated by new lines (\n).

2. **User Input Processing**:
   - The application takes user input, which includes the text and the chosen banner style.

3. **Loading Banner Styles**:
   - The chosen banner style's ASCII art template is loaded from the corresponding text file in the "banners" directory.

4. **Text to ASCII Art Conversion**:
   - The input text is split into lines, where each line represents a line of ASCII art.
   - For each line of text:
     - The line is split into individual characters.
     - For each character:
       - The character's ASCII value is checked to ensure it falls within the Basic Latin character range (ASCII values 32 to 126).
       - If the character is within this range, its corresponding pattern from the banner style's ASCII art template is retrieved.
       - The patterns of all characters in the line are concatenated to form the ASCII art representation for that line.
       - The process is repeated for each of the 8 lines in the character's pattern.
       - The application maps each character to its corresponding pattern in the banner style, resulting in the ASCII art representation for each line of text.

5. **Rendering the Result**:
   - The generated ASCII art, along with the original input text and chosen banner style, is rendered on the result page for the user to view.


### Web Application Framework

Ascii-Art-Web is built on the Go programming language and the net/http package. It consists of the following main components:

- **Main Page Handler**: Renders the main page where users input text and select a banner style.

- **ASCII Art Handler**: Processes user input, generates ASCII art, and renders the result page.

- **Not Found Handler**: Handles cases where users access non-existent routes.

## Extensible and Scalable

The application is designed to be extensible, allowing for easy addition of new banner styles by creating corresponding text files in the "banners" directory. 
- To add custome Banner File make sure:
  - Banner Format

    - Each character has a height of 8 lines.
    - Characters are separated by a new line \n.

  Here is an example of  '!' (one dot represents one space) :

```sh
......
......
......
......
......
......
......
......

._..
|.|.
|.|.
|.|.
|_|.
(_).
....
....
```
The flexible nature of Go's web framework enables further feature enhancements and improvements.
